          As value is moving to Web3 en masse, it moves further away from any
          centralized power held by nation states. While Web2 already gave rise
          to the cybereconomy, such economy was still piggybacking off old
          systems. Web3 is truly Internet-native. Web3 grows faster as it's
          further away from physical violence, political instability and endless
          bureaucracy.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          And for the first time in humankind's history, as value moves to Web3,
          the Internet will determine the shape of our new society.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          People are now feeling they belong more to niche Internet communities
          and DAOs, rather than massive nation states.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Remote work is becoming the rule and not the exception.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Work itself is becoming more like compartmentalized tasks rather than
          9-to-5 jobs.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Corporations are becoming fluid DAOs and not forever-lasting
          hierarchical institutions.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          People are starting to see nation states as service providers, rather
          than rulers. And they are moving to wherever these providers offer
          them a fair deal.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          For the first time Web3 gives us the opportunity to un-bundle the
          services that nation states provide, make them 100x better and ensure
          they are community-owned. The result will be a new, open source stack
          for running Web3-powered nation states: the Nation3 stack.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Even nation states themselves will help in this journey, as they start
          to compete against each other. Some are already making moves, such as
          allowing Bitcoin as legal tender or attracting skilled individuals
          with fair tax deals. We have entered the era of jurisdictional
          competition.
