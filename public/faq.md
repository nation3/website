## What is Nation3 and what is it trying to achieve?

Nation3 is building a Web3-powered, tax-free, solarpunk cloud nation, with a view of obtaining physical territories further down the line.

Historically, traditional nation states currently have had a monopoly over services they provide. Our vision is to unbundle that and gradually build or invest in products and services that allow our Citizens to be actively involved in economic activity and have a high quality of life, while living harmoniously with nature.

We defined our vision the Nation3 [manifesto](https://nation3.org/manifesto) which we encourage you to read.

## How is Nation3 structured?

Nation3 is structured as a DAO, meaning there is no legal entity, no gatekeepers, and no influence by trad states.

## How can I get involved?

To get involved in the organisation, you would need to get your hands on some $NATION - the governance token of the DAO. You can either buy some [here](https://app.balancer.fi/#/trade/ether/0x333A4823466879eeF910A04D473505da62142069), or you can earn it by completing some of he openly available tasks on [Dework](https://app.dework.xyz/nation3).

Once you have $NATION, [you can lock it](https://app.nation3.org/lock) in exchange for $veNATION - the non-transferrable, time-locked version of the token that proves your skin-in-the-game, grants you governance weight and gives you access to token-gated channels. If you hold a minimum of 2 $veNATION, [you can become a Genesis Citizen](https://app.nation3.org/join) by grabbing one of the only [420 Genesis Passports.](https://opensea.io/collection/nation3-genesis-passport)

Once you are a Citizen (or, for now, a holder of a minimal $veNATION balance) you will be able to verify yourself on our community discord and get access to all channels. This will also unlock the rest of Citizen-only Dework tasks.

## What benefits does $NATION give me?

Holding $NATION is like holding a stake in a rapidly growing tech nation - we strongly believe that each citizen should be incentivised and directly benefit from the success of the nation they belong to.

$NATION also serves as the entry point to the Nation3 ecosystem and is required to be locked in order to:

- get a passport
- get boosted rewards on the [$NATION / $ETH Balancer pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x0bf37157d30dfe6f56757dcadff01aed83b08cd600020000000000000000019a)
- get governance power & ability to participate in decision-making
- enter into [collateral Agreements and use the Court](https://forum.nation3.org/t/nation3-court-a-backbone-to-bootstrap-a-circular-economy-by-increasing-trust-between-citizens/553) (underway, soon to be released)
- claim UBI (to be released)
- be able to participate in social insurance circles and other services (to be released)

## What happens with my $NATION when I lock it?

When you [lock your $NATION,](https://app.nation3.org/lock) you won’t be able to trade or access it until its expiration date, and in its place you are issued with $veNATION - the non-transferable, time-locked version of the token.

It’s important to note that your $veNATION balance is a representation of your skin-in-the-game, and therefore is _dynamic:_ as time passes and the remainder of time lock decreases (hence, you have less commitment left in financial terms), your $veNATION balance decreases (and with it, your voting power). Your underlying $NATION, however, doesn’t disappear: it unlocks incrementally, and you can either keep, re-lock, or sell it as you please. To keep your passport, you need to make sure that your balance is **never** below 2 $veNATION (it’s a good idea to have some buffer to make sure you don’t lose your passport).

## How many passports are currently available?

Only 420 Genesis Passports will ever be available. There is still an opportunity [to claim yours](https://app.nation3.org/join).

Ordinary passports will likely be issued at a later stage, requiring a lower $veNATION balance.

## Can I become a Citizen if I cannot afford to buy enough $NATION for a passport?

Glad you asked! As soon as ordinary passports are launched (currently only 420 Genesis Passports are available), there will be a mechanism to ‘earn’ a passport by applying, having existing citizens vouch for you, and completing tasks.

## What does Nation3's governance process look like?

Nation3 has just ratified a new governance process that aims to remove the over-reliance on the abstract human language and instead **use data structures, type checking and smart contracts** to make governance simple, fast, and transparent. You can read more about the Nation3 governance process, the types and stages of proposals [here](https://github.com/nation3/gov/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md).

You can make a new proposal or find all existing proposals at our [governance portal](https://gov.nation3.org/).
